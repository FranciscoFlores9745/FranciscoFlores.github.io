The interactive features that will have the most impact are the hamburger menu buttons because it will help with the organization of the website. This is useful for the community I am making the website for because there are people who play games on all kinds of devices, so having interactivity that works best with computers and another with mobile would help with that accessibility.  I should also probably consider screen sizes  and how I should set up my website based on that since they could either be using a monitor, tv, or their phone/tablet. Another interactive feature I will add is a possible filter to only see information that you want, so you can choose either to see game reviews, game development, Industry news, neither, or all of them.



The feedback that I had gotten was that I should add a button to each of the information on the homepage, so that if what the user saw was enticing enough for them to learn more, then they could click on it to see if there is any more information that they might have missed. Also add more images to maybe fill in the space more so that they got something else to look at if they don’t want to veer off from the information.

What worked though was the navigation between the pages and stark difference between each page so that the user doesn’t get lost.

My plan is to now not only add filters to the two pages, but to also make sure that there is a button the user can click so that they aren’t limited to the information that is just in that container and that they can for themselves find more information. And then if I have time to add more appeasing visuals so that the website doesn’t make the user as bored.  


Another piece of feedback was to maybe make the filters act like a checklist, that way you can either choose 1 thing to focus on, or just filter out one thing, that way the information that you want stays while the other information disappears. 

Other than that the rest of the additions I made were effective and were welcomed by the user.


My plan to finalize this is to update my filter function so that it can do dynamic checklist type filtering, where you can choose multiple things instead of being forced to pick one to filter.

My grid layout serves my community's needs because it helps organize the information the user sees, that way they won’t get lost and are able to easily find the information that they need.  The javascript features that help with the community's problems are the filters, the hamburger menu, and the more info buttons because it gives the user more control over what they want to see. It also helps organize the information that way the user doesn’t feel overwhelmed by the amount of information they are receiving. The accessibility features that were most important for my community for me to consider was keyboard accessibility and the state of some buttons in the code so that there are other ways to navigate the website.


What I learned from testing my target community was that they want to feel like they have as much control in what they are seeing as possible, this is so that they can focus on what they think is important. The feedback I got challenged how I perceived user interactive on a good website, because to them in order for a website to be good, it needs to have the least among of restrictions as possible, and even if the website has everything for them, if it feels to restrictive, then it makes the user experience worse not better. What I would change is how the hamburger menu functions when you click outside to close and more visual confirmation for the filter buttons to know which one is active.

The only data that I am storing from the user is the filters, so there should be no issue for information security for the user. My interactive features give users more control over what they see because it allows them to choose what they want to see and what they want to hide. And if they want to see more they can if they choose to. The biases that are embedded into my code are most likely reading from left to right because most of the layout is  surrounded by that.
