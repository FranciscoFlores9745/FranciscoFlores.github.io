The interactive features that will have the most impact are the hamburger menu buttons because it will help with the organization of the website. This is useful for the community I am making the website for because there are people who play games on all kinds of devices, so having interactivity that works best with computers and another with mobile would help with that accessibility.  I should also probably consider screen sizes  and how I should set up my website based on that since they could either be using a monitor, tv, or their phone/tablet. Another interactive feature I will add is a possible filter to only see information that you want, so you can choose either to see game reviews, game development, Industry news, neither, or all of them.



The feedback that I had gotten was that I should add a button to each of the information on the homepage, so that if what the user saw was enticing enough for them to learn more, then they could click on it to see if there is any more information that they might have missed. Also add more images to maybe fill in the space more so that they got something else to look at if they don’t want to veer off from the information.

What worked though was the navigation between the pages and stark difference between each page so that the user doesn’t get lost.

My plan is to now not only add filters to the two pages, but to also make sure that there is a button the user can click so that they aren’t limited to the information that is just in that container and that they can for themselves find more information. And then if I have time to add more appeasing visuals so that the website doesn’t make the user as bored.  


Another piece of feedback was to maybe make the filters act like a checklist, that way you can either choose 1 thing to focus on, or just filter out one thing, that way the information that you want stays while the other information disappears. 

Other than that the rest of the additions I made were effective and were a welcomed addition to the use of the user.


My plan to finalize this is to update my filter function so that it can do dynamic checklist type filtering, where you can choose multiple things instead of being forced to pick one to filter.
